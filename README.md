## Loss of Context with AsyncLocalStorage
A practical guide to understanding and resolving issues with AsyncLocalStorage and async_hooks losing context in Node.js applications.

## Overview
This repository aims to provide practical examples and insights into scenarios where AsyncLocalStorage loses its context. It also highlights certain npm packages and practices that may disrupt the asynchronous promise chain, causing context-related issues.

## Objectives
Practical Examples: Demonstrate real-world examples of context loss using AsyncLocalStorage.
Identify Problematic Packages: Highlight npm packages and common patterns that can cause disruptions in the async chain.
Educate and Guide: Offer actionable solutions and best practices to maintain context integrity in Node.js applications.
Why This Matters
Maintaining context is crucial for features like request tracing, logging, and user session handling in modern web applications. Understanding how and why context loss occurs can save you from potential debugging nightmares and ensure smoother application performance.

## Getting Started
To explore the examples provided in this repository, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the respective example directories.

## bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loss-context-with-async-local-storage.git
cd loss-context-with-async-local-storage
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
npm (or yarn)
How to Use
Run Examples: Navigate to the desired example folder and execute the script to observe the behavior of AsyncLocalStorage in different scenarios.

## Test Your Code: Use the repository as a reference to test and debug your own implementation of AsyncLocalStorage.

## Common Issues Highlighted
Improper usage of asynchronous APIs that break the async chain.
Third-party npm packages that inadvertently clear or overwrite context.
Misconfigured middleware or utility functions in the application stack.
